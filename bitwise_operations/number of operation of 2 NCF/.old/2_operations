Problem StatementGiven a positive integer $n$ (up to $2^{60}$), you need to reduce it to 0 using the minimum number of operations. In one operation, you can either:Add $2^i$ (any power of 2, where $i \ge 0$)Subtract $2^i$The goal is to find that minimum count of additions and subtractions.What is NAF (Non-Adjacent Form)?You mentioned "NCF"—you likely mean NAF (Non-Adjacent Form). This is a specific way of representing numbers that is incredibly popular in cryptography (like Elliptic Curve Cryptography) because it minimizes the "weight" of a number.Standard Binary: Uses digits $\{0, 1\}$.NAF: Uses digits $\{0, 1, -1\}$.The Rule: No two non-zero digits can be next to each other (i.e., you'll never see 1, 1 or 1, -1).Why it matters here: Every non-zero digit in a NAF representation corresponds to one addition or subtraction. Since NAF is guaranteed to have the minimum number of non-zero digits for any integer, finding the NAF weight is exactly the same as finding your "minimum operations."The Approach: "Greedy Bitwise Strategy"Since we want to eliminate as many $1$s as possible in the fewest moves, we look at the binary bits from right to left (least significant to most significant).If $n$ is even: The last bit is 0. We don't need an operation. We just shift right (divide by 2) and move to the next bit.If $n$ is odd: We must perform an operation. To decide whether to add or subtract, we look at the next bit:Case ...01 (Ends in 1): Subtracting $1$ is best. It clears the bit and leaves a 0 behind.Case ...11 (Ends in 3): Adding $1$ is better. It turns 11 into 100 (via a carry). You’ve turned two $1$s into a single $1$ further down the line, potentially saving many operations if there was a long string of $1$s.Code Implementation (Python)This approach is $O(\log n)$, which is perfect for the $2^{60}$ constraint (it will run in about 60 iterations).Pythondef getMinOperations(n):
    operations = 0
    
    while n > 0:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            # Bit is 0, no operation needed. 
            # Shift right to look at the next bit.
            n //= 2
        else:
            # Bit is 1, an operation is required.
            # Look at the last two bits using (n & 3).
            # 3 in binary is '11'.
            if (n & 3) == 3:
                # If it ends in '11', adding 1 is more efficient 
                # because it triggers a carry.
                n += 1
            else:
                # If it ends in '01', just subtract the 1.
                n -= 1
            
            operations += 1
            
    return operations

# Example Testing
print(f"Ops for 5: {getMinOperations(5)}")   # Output: 2
print(f"Ops for 21: {getMinOperations(21)}") # Output: 3
Why this handles the $2^{60}$ constraint:Memory: It only stores a few integers, so it uses almost no RAM.Speed: Even at $2^{60}$, the while loop runs a maximum of ~62 times. On a modern CPU, this completes in microseconds.Would you like me to show you how to adapt this logic if the problem restricted you to only subtractions?

Example:

nums = [2,2,2,3]


Solution (Bit counting):

result = 0
for i in range(32):  # for each bit
    bit_sum = 0
    for n in nums:
        bit_sum += (n >> i) & 1
    result |= (bit_sum % 3) << i
return result


Explanation:

Count 1s in each bit position across all numbers

Mod 3 → bits of the number appearing once remain

Reconstruct the number from bits

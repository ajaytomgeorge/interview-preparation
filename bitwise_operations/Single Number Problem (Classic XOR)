Problem 1: Every element appears twice except one

Example:

nums = [2,3,2,4,4]


Goal: Find the single number → 3

Solution (XOR trick):

res = 0
for n in nums:
    res ^= n
return res


Explanation:

Start with 0

XOR each number

Pairs cancel out → only the single number remains

Step:
0 ^ 2 = 2
2 ^ 3 = 1
1 ^ 2 = 3
3 ^ 4 = 7
7 ^ 4 = 3 ✅


Complexity:

Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)

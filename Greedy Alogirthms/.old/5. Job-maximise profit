6️⃣ Job Sequencing with Deadlines

Problem
Each job has a deadline and profit. Do jobs to maximize profit (1 job per unit time).

Greedy choice

Sort jobs by profit (descending)

Schedule each job as late as possible before its deadline

Example

Jobs: (profit, deadline)
A (100, 2)
B (19, 1)
C (27, 2)
D (25, 1)

Optimal profit = 127

Exolanation
No worries — this problem is confusing the first time you see it.
Let’s explain it very slowly, with intuition and a real-life analogy.

🧠 Job Sequencing with Deadlines — Plain English

You are given jobs.
Each job:

Takes exactly 1 unit of time

Must be done before a deadline

Gives you some profit

👉 You can do only ONE job at a time
👉 Your goal is to earn maximum total profit

🏭 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you run a small workshop:

You can do only one job per day

Each job:

Must be finished before a certain day

Pays you some money

💡 You want to choose which jobs to do and when to earn maximum money.

📌 Example
Job	Deadline	Profit
A	2	100
B	1	19
C	2	27
D	1	25
E	3	15
What does this mean?

Job A must be done by day 2

Job B must be done by day 1

Job E must be done by day 3

Each job takes 1 day

🗓 Time Slots Visualization

Maximum deadline = 3

So we have 3 time slots:

Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3


We can place only one job per day.

❌ Why Can’t We Do All Jobs?

There are 5 jobs but only 3 days → impossible to do all.

So we must choose wisely.

🧠 Greedy Idea (Core Insight)
1️⃣ Pick jobs with highest profit first
2️⃣ Do them as late as possible before their deadline

Why late?
👉 To keep earlier days free for other jobs.

✅ Step-by-Step Scheduling
Step 1: Sort by profit (descending)
A(100), C(27), D(25), B(19), E(15)

Step 2: Try to place each job
Job A (deadline = 2)

Place it on Day 2

Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3
  -   |   A   |   -

Job C (deadline = 2)

Day 2 is full → try Day 1

Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3
  C   |   A   |   -

Job D (deadline = 1)

Day 1 is full → ❌ skip

Job B (deadline = 1)

Day 1 is full → ❌ skip

Job E (deadline = 3)

Place on Day 3

Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3
  C   |   A   |   E

🏆 Final Result

Jobs done: C, A, E

Total profit = 27 + 100 + 15 = 142

✅ Why Greedy Works Here

High-profit jobs are more important

Scheduling late avoids blocking other jobs

Local optimal decisions lead to global optimal profit

📌 One-Line Exam Explanation

Job Sequencing with Deadlines schedules jobs by sorting them in descending profit order and placing each job in the latest available slot before its deadline to maximize total profit.

🧠 Key Takeaway
Concept	Meaning
1 job per unit time	Can’t do two jobs on same day
Deadline	Last day job can be done
Profit	Money earned
Goal	Maximize profit
Strategy	Greedy

🧑‍💻 Python Implementation
def job_sequencing(jobs):
    """
    jobs: list of tuples (job_id, deadline, profit)
    returns: total profit and scheduled jobs
    """

    # Sort jobs by profit (descending)
    jobs.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

    # Find maximum deadline
    max_deadline = max(job[1] for job in jobs)

    # Create slots (None means free)
    slots = [None] * max_deadline
    total_profit = 0

    for job_id, deadline, profit in jobs:
        # Try to place job as late as possible
        for i in range(deadline - 1, -1, -1):
            if slots[i] is None:
                slots[i] = job_id
                total_profit += profit
                break

    return total_profit, slots

📌 Example Usage
jobs = [
    ('A', 2, 100),
    ('B', 1, 19),
    ('C', 2, 27),
    ('D', 1, 25),
    ('E', 3, 15)
]

profit, schedule = job_sequencing(jobs)
print("Total Profit:", profit)
print("Schedule:", schedule)

Output
Total Profit: 142
Schedule: ['C', 'A', 'E']

🧠 Memory Trick for Exams

Profit first → Place late → Max profit

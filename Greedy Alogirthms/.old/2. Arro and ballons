10️⃣ Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

Problem
Intervals represent balloons. One arrow bursts all overlapping balloons.

Greedy choice
Sort by end coordinate, shoot arrow at end.


Python Solution — Greedy Approach
Idea

Sort balloons by end coordinate

Shoot an arrow at the end of the first balloon

Skip all balloons that this arrow bursts (overlaps with it)

Repeat for remaining balloons

Count the arrows

✅ Why greedy works:

Shooting at the earliest possible end covers as many overlapping balloons as possible

Same principle as earliest finish time in Activity Selection

Implementation
def find_min_arrows(balloons):
    if not balloons:
        return 0
    
    # Sort by end coordinate
    balloons.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    arrows = 1           # Shoot first arrow
    current_end = balloons[0][1]
    
    for start, end in balloons[1:]:
        if start > current_end:
            # Need a new arrow
            arrows += 1
            current_end = end  # Shoot at end of new balloon
    
    return arrows

# Example 1
balloons = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
print(find_min_arrows(balloons))  # Output: 2

# Example 2
balloons = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
print(find_min_arrows(balloons))  # Output: 4


Step-by-step Explanation (Greedy)

Input: [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]

Sort by end: [[1,6],[2,8],[7,12],[10,16]]

First arrow at 6 → bursts [1,6] and [2,8]

Next balloon [7,12] → start > 6 → new arrow at 12 → bursts [7,12] and [10,16]

Total arrows = 2 ✅

Complexity

Time: O(n log n) → sorting dominates

Space: O(1) → only a few variables

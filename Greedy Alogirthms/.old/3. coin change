2️⃣ Coin Change (Greedy version)

Problem
Given coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins to make a value.

Greedy choice
Always pick the largest coin ≤ remaining amount.

Example

Coins: [25, 10, 5, 1]
Amount: 63

25 + 25 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 coins


⚠️ Important interview caveat
Greedy does NOT always work for arbitrary coin systems.

Counterexample

Coins: [1, 3, 4]
Amount: 6

Greedy: 4 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins
Optimal: 3 + 3 = 2 coins


7️⃣ Minimum Number of Coins to Make Change (Canonical Systems)

Problem
Same as coin change, but interviewer asks when greedy is correct.

Answer
Greedy works for canonical coin systems like:

US coins: 1, 5, 10, 25

solution
Coin Change problem greedy works only on canocial coins else we have toi use dp 


1️⃣ Greedy Solution (Canonical Coins Only)
def coin_change_greedy(coins, amount):
    """
    Greedy approach works only if coins are canonical (like [1,5,10,25])
    """
    coins.sort(reverse=True)  # Start with largest coin
    count = 0
    remaining = amount
    
    for coin in coins:
        if remaining == 0:
            break
        take = remaining // coin
        count += take
        remaining -= take * coin
    
    if remaining != 0:
        return -1  # Cannot make exact amount
    return count

# Example: US Coins (Canonical)
coins = [25, 10, 5, 1]
amount = 63
print("Greedy:", coin_change_greedy(coins, amount))  # Output: 6


✅ Notes:

Works only with canonical coins.

Very fast: O(n) after sorting.

Will fail for non-canonical coins (e.g., [1,3,4]).

2️⃣ DP Solution (All Coins)
def coin_change_dp(coins, amount):
    """
    Dynamic Programming approach works for any coin system
    """
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # 0 coins needed for amount 0
    
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for c in coins:
            if i - c >= 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - c] + 1)
    
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1

# Example: Non-canonical coins
coins = [1, 3, 4]
amount = 6
print("DP:", coin_change_dp(coins, amount))  # Output: 2

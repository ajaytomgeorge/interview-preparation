A topological sort(applicable only to Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) 

An ordering of nodes

Valid only for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

Based purely on dependencies

Ignores edge weights completely


For every directed edge u → v, u comes before v in the ordering.


Short answer

❌ No.
Topological sort is NOT a shortest path algorithm.

But…

✅ It is used inside a shortest path algorithm (for DAGs).
The actual DAG shortest path algorithm
Step-by-step

Topological sort the DAG

Set dist[source] = 0, others = ∞

For each node u in topo order:

For each edge u → v:

dist[v] = min(dist[v], dist[u] + weight(u, v))


✔️ Works even with negative weights
✔️ Runs in O(V + E)

Why topological order makes this work

In a DAG:

Once you process a node in topo order,

No future node can point back to it

So its shortest distance is final

This is similar in spirit to Dijkstra — but without heaps.

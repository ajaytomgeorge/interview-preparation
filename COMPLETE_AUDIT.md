## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Definitely Needs Conversion)
1. `Greedy Alogirthms/1. activity_slection` → `activity_selection.md`
2. `Greedy Alogirthms/6. Jump Game` → `Jump_Game.md`
3. `bitwise_operations/number of operation of 2 NCF/2_operations` → `2_operations.md`

### Priority 2 (Check & Convert)
- All remaining files in `Greedy Alogirthms/` folder
- `trees/NewTreeBalanced` → `NewTreeBalanced.md`

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Convert all 10 files without extensions to `.md`?
2. Check content of each file before conversion?
3. Focus only on priority files?
4. Generate conversion for specific folders?

Let me know which approach you prefer!

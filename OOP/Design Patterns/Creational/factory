The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses or a "factory" class to alter the type of objects that will be created.

In simple terms: instead of calling Class() directly (which is like going to a construction site and building a car yourself), you call a Factory (which is like going to a dealership and saying, "I want a truck").

1. The Problem: Tight Coupling
If you hard-code object creation using if/else logic throughout your app, adding a new type of object requires you to hunt down and change every single piece of code.

Python
# WITHOUT A FACTORY
def get_transport(type):
    if type == "truck":
        return Truck()
    elif type == "ship":
        return Ship()
    # If we add 'Plane', we have to find this function and change it.
2. The Solution: Simple Factory
In Python, we use a dedicated class or method to handle the "creation logic."

Python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# 1. The Product Interface
class Transport(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def deliver(self): pass

# 2. Concrete Products
class Truck(Transport):
    def deliver(self): return "Delivering by land in a crate."

class Ship(Transport):
    def deliver(self): return "Delivering by sea in a container."

# 3. The Factory
class TransportFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_transport(mode):
        if mode == "land":
            return Truck()
        if mode == "sea":
            return Ship()
        raise ValueError("Unknown transport mode")

# 4. Usage
my_delivery = TransportFactory.create_transport("land")
print(my_delivery.deliver())
3. Why use the Factory Pattern?
Decoupling: The "User" of the object doesn't need to know how the object is built or even the name of the specific class. They only care about the interface (deliver).

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): You move all the creation logic into one place.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): You can add new transport types (like Plane) by adding a new class and updating the factory, without touching the main business logic.

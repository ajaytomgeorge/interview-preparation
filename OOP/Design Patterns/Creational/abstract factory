Think of it this way: the Factory Method produces one product, while the Abstract Factory produces a family of related products.1. The Key DifferenceFactory Method: Focuses on a single product. For example, a ButtonFactory creates different types of buttons (Windows buttons, Mac buttons).Abstract Factory: Focuses on families of objects. For example, a UIFactory creates a button, a checkbox, and a scrollbar that all share the same "theme" (Windows or Mac).2. Factory Method Example (Single Product)You have one "creator" that decides which single class to instantiate.Pythonclass ButtonFactory:
    def create_button(self, os_type):
        if os_type == "Windows":
            return WindowsButton()
        return MacButton()
3. Abstract Factory Example (Product Families)This is an "Interface of Factories." It ensures that all the parts of your system match each other.Pythonfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# --- Abstract Products ---
class Button(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def click(self): pass

class Checkbox(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def toggle(self): pass

# --- Abstract Factory ---
class UIFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_button(self) -> Button: pass

    @abstractmethod
    def create_checkbox(self) -> Checkbox: pass

# --- Concrete Factory 1 (Windows) ---
class WindowsFactory(UIFactory):
    def create_button(self): return WindowsButton()
    def create_checkbox(self): return WindowsCheckbox()

# --- Concrete Factory 2 (Mac) ---
class MacFactory(UIFactory):
    def create_button(self): return MacButton()
    def create_checkbox(self): return MacCheckbox()

Comparison TableFeatureFactory MethodAbstract FactoryComplexitySimpleHigherFocusHow one thing is created.How multiple related things are created.StructureUses inheritance (subclasses override a method).Uses composition (the factory object is passed in).ChangeEasy to add a new product type.Easy to add a whole new "theme" or family.
